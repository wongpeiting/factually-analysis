# Factually, in one chart

I was curious if Singapore's government-run fact-checking site, Factually.gov.sg, showed any patterns around election time, so I scraped the 124 corrections and clarifications they've published, organised the info in a spreadsheet, and started poking around.

## This repo contains:
- `factually_pofma_cleaned.csv` - All 124 Factually correction and clarification articles (2018 to Feb 9, 2026) slotted into topics and categorized according to the parties they are directed towards.
- `factually_analysis_refined.ipynb` - The notebook where I did the analysis
- `output1.png` and `output2.png` - Two charts 

Note: Factually started in 2012, but it currently only hosts articles from Jan 2018 onward on its site. According to [this journal article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/18681034211008908), it published sparingly prior to 2018, with a total of 15 articles between 2013 and 2017.
